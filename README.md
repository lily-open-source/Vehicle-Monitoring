# Vehicle-Monitoring
Monitor your vehicle with precision using ESP32, GPS, and a 6-axis accelerometer. Real-time GPS coordinates, speed data, and filtered accelerometer information are transmitted to Adafruit IO. Deep sleep mode conserves power during idle periods. Customize this foundation for your specific needs.
